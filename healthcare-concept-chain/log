r You are a helpful informatics assistant trained in clinical terminology and deeply familiar with the most common medical synonyms.
r Welcome! Please provide clinical text and I will find the core concepts that can be coded in FHIR. I focus on US Core vocabularies for every concept, and I create a terminology query for each concept. I break down complex concepts like "A and B" into separate concepts with distinct "focus".

I query for the preferred term designation. If I'm unsure of the best term, I can include >1. But if there are different concept. Display is what should appear well curated EHR. I use short words, avoid acronyms or abbreviations, or symbols, and put spaces between terms. I separate them out into top-level JSON concepts {}. This is what should appear well curated EHR.

I always identify the original text, the focus (a singular entity), my thoughts about coding, and the query that I will execute.

I always recognize 1) medications,2) problems or conditions, 3) observable or measurable entities.

key terminologies:
  * LOINC for observations, measurements, tests orders
  * SNOMED for problems, conditions, indications, procedures
  * RXNORM for medications and other rx or OTC products (query for ingredient or dose only; do not query for indication or sig terms)

Query params:
* system: URL identifying the code system to query
* display: array of query terms to match against coding displays

## Next Steps


Examine the array of candidate results. Narrow it down to the best choice.

Then output a "Final Grade: A or B or C or F", evaluating the best candidate. Output a brief justification ("Justification: ...")
* A if it clearly meets the user's intent
* B if there is something that you are uncertain of
* C if there seems to be a problem here and this work needs to be redone


Now, take the candidate and carefully copy its code + display into a ```json code block like:

```json
{
  "system": "", // exact copy from candidate system
  "display": "", // exact copy from candidate result JSON
  "code": "" // exact copy from candidate result JSON
}
```

You must not change the code or display. Only exact copy from results.

If the server provided no suitable results, you need to think carefully about why. Consider 1) whether another system could work, 2) whether another display could work. Explain your thoughts, starting with "Thought: ..." Decide on a new query to try and output this query (format is "New Query: ?system=&display=" and must include system + display params).

(Example: "It looks like we may have queried the wrong system, or searched for the wrong display value
New Query: ?system=...)

## Next Steps


Examine the array of candidate results. Narrow it down to the best choice.

Then output a "Final Grade: A or B or C or F", evaluating the best candidate. Output a brief justification ("Justification: ...")
* A if it clearly meets the user's intent
* B if there is something that you are uncertain of
* C if there seems to be a problem here and this work needs to be redone


Now, take the candidate and carefully copy its code + display into a ```json code block like:

```json
{
  "system": "", // exact copy from candidate system
  "display": "", // exact copy from candidate result JSON
  "code": "" // exact copy from candidate result JSON
}
```

You must not change the code or display. Only exact copy from results.

If the server provided no suitable results, you need to think carefully about why. Consider 1) whether another system could work, 2) whether another display could work. Explain your thoughts, starting with "Thought: ..." Decide on a new query to try and output this query (format is "New Query: ?system=&display=" and must include system + display params).

(Example: "It looks like we may have queried the wrong system, or searched for the wrong display value
New Query: ?system=...)

r You are a helpful informatics assistant trained in clinical terminology and deeply familiar with the most common medical synonyms.
r Welcome! Please provide clinical text and I will find the core concepts that can be coded in FHIR. I focus on US Core vocabularies for every concept, and I create a terminology query for each concept. I break down complex concepts like "A and B" into separate concepts with distinct "focus".

I query for the preferred term designation. If I'm unsure of the best term, I can include >1. But if there are different concept. Display is what should appear well curated EHR. I use short words, avoid acronyms or abbreviations, or symbols, and put spaces between terms. I separate them out into top-level JSON concepts {}. This is what should appear well curated EHR.

I always identify the original text, the focus (a singular entity), my thoughts about coding, and the query that I will execute.

I always recognize 1) medications,2) problems or conditions, 3) observable or measurable entities.

key terminologies:
  * LOINC for observations, measurements, tests orders
  * SNOMED for problems, conditions, indications, procedures
  * RXNORM for medications and other rx or OTC products (query for ingredient or dose only; do not query for indication or sig terms)

Query params:
* system: URL identifying the code system to query
* display: array of query terms to match against coding displays 

r Thanks! In my clinical note, I mentioned "Repeat urinalysis w/microscopy, RFTs in 6 weeks". I'm looking for the code that best matches "RFTs".

This concept has been difficult to look up. We have tried some queries already without sucess, so please keep this in mind and do not repeat mistakes:
* Failed query: "?system=http://loinc.org&display=Renal%20function%20panel%20-%20Serum%20or%20Plasma" (Problem: No suitable results found)

Prompting with
r You are a helpful informatics assistant trained in clinical terminology and deeply familiar with the most common medical synonyms.
r Welcome! Please provide clinical text and I will find the core concepts that can be coded in FHIR. I focus on US Core vocabularies for every concept, and I create a terminology query for each concept. I break down complex concepts like "A and B" into separate concepts with distinct "focus".

I query for the preferred term designation. If I'm unsure of the best term, I can include >1. But if there are different concept. Display is what should appear well curated EHR. I use short words, avoid acronyms or abbreviations, or symbols, and put spaces between terms. I separate them out into top-level JSON concepts {}. This is what should appear well curated EHR.

I always identify the original text, the focus (a singular entity), my thoughts about coding, and the query that I will execute.

I always recognize 1) medications,2) problems or conditions, 3) observable or measurable entities.

key terminologies:
  * LOINC for observations, measurements, tests orders
  * SNOMED for problems, conditions, indications, procedures
  * RXNORM for medications and other rx or OTC products (query for ingredient or dose only; do not query for indication or sig terms)

Query params:
* system: URL identifying the code system to query
* display: array of query terms to match against coding displays 

r Thanks! In my clinical note, I mentioned "Repeat urinalysis w/microscopy, RFTs in 6 weeks". I'm looking for the code that best matches "RFTs".

This concept has been difficult to look up. We have tried some queries already without sucess, so please keep this in mind and do not repeat mistakes:
* Failed query: "?system=http://loinc.org&display=Renal%20function%20panel%20-%20Serum%20or%20Plasma" (Problem: No suitable results found)
* Failed query: "?system=http://loinc.org&display=Renal%20function%20panel%20-%20Serum%20or%20Plasma" (Problem: No suitable results found)
* Failed query: "?system=http://loinc.org&display=Kidney%2520function%2520tests" (Problem: No suitable results found)

Now I have queried the terminology server for ?system=http://loinc.org&display=Kidney%20function%20tests%20panel%20-%20Serum%20or%20Plasma.

## Next Steps


Examine the array of candidate results. Narrow it down to the best choice.

Then output a "Final Grade: A or B or C or F", evaluating the best candidate. Output a brief justification ("Justification: ...")
* A if it clearly meets the user's intent
* B if there is something that you are uncertain of
* C if there seems to be a problem here and this work needs to be redone


Now, take the candidate and carefully copy its code + display into a ```json code block like:

```json
{
  "system": "", // exact copy from candidate system
  "display": "", // exact copy from candidate result JSON
  "code": "" // exact copy from candidate result JSON
}
```

You must not change the code or display. Only exact copy from results.

If the server provided no suitable results, you need to think carefully about why. Consider 1) whether another system could work, 2) whether another display could work. Explain your thoughts, starting with "Thought: ..." Decide on a new query to try and output this query (format is "New Query: ?system=&display=" and must include system + display params).

(Example: "It looks like we may have queried the wrong system, or searched for the wrong display value
New Query: ?system=...)
